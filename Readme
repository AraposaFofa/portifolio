This is my portifolio web page repository. Do not pull requests that are for trolling (there is another repository for that).

Anyway, I work using alot of single files for each main element style and alot of single files for each main script.

This way, things are easier to understand and easier to change, but it makes the server slower.

Basically the file organization in production prerelease is something like this:

portifolio
  |_ index.html
  |_ Styles
  | |_ styleFooter.css
  | |_ styleNav.css
  | |_ container.css
  |_Scripts
    |_ scriptClock.js

and so on.

In my main server things are different.

First I organize and comment each individual file them merge some of them together. Semantically, this makes things worser, but, for training, I merge only things 
that are good to be merged (like merging footer and article styles or clock and some time of cool message). This makes things easier for the server and for me.

Basically, if you see a folder called "forTheServer" it is the merged files for releasing. 

You can pull requests at any time, I keep backups of that file, so trolls can feel free to do anything.



I'm working on two projects (as my portifolio will display) that are basically a intranet for a company and a app for task management.

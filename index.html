            <h2>Some Of My Competences</h2>
            <h3>C</h3>
            <p>C, the core of most languages and most systems (and one of most popular language). I know a bit about C,
                like pointers, casting, FILO and LIFO. I would consider myself on intermediate level, there is not a lot of
                projects do to in C on my own. Anyway, I learnt that on school, made some cool programs to read files and etcetera.
            </p>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>
                Java is a popular high level language among android developers, web developers and applet developers. Maybe as 
                popular as C, Python, C++ or JavaScript. Anyway, I know a bit (not so much as some senior Java developer) of 
                Java, I used to make some greenfoot games to play with my friends. Made a simple meeting agenda for my colleges
                and some little things to make my school work easier (although it was simple projects).
                Basically I would consider myself on intermediate level of the language (as in C). I know about OOP, polimorfism,
                constructors, setters and getters, encapsulation, inheritance, some libraries of I/O, greenfoot and just that.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                Well, I made this web page myself using for frontend pure HTML and CSS without frameworks like tailwind or (futurally)
                bootstrap and (not now) JavaScript, MongoDB and a bit of PHP. As mainly a web developer, I know about wordpress, servers
                and things as such that people communly use. I would consider myself on advanced level of HTMl and intermediate level
                of CSS and JavaScript (As I write this, I did not learn DOM). In databases I would consider myself on intermediate level,
                I just use PHPMYADMIN or MongoDB GUI to manage my databases.  
            </p>
            <h3>Trying To Develop</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm learning Kotlin, more about Java and android studio for making a app for my company (a sort of form). 
                    I learned alot of for now, like the R library, XML and the studio interface.
                    For now, it is just that, I think
